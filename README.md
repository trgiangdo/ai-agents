For each agent:
- Rename the `.env_example` file to `.env`
- Update the `.env` file with the appropriate values for your environment

Review agent libraries:
- `smolagents` is minimal, suitable for prototyping with basic Python tools. The CodeAgent provided by smolagents are
    simple and very flexible, but not providing much features for controlling the agent.
- `langgraph` is more advanced, providing a framework for building agents with more complex workflows and state management. The developer needs to build a graph for the agent to follow, which can be more beneficial for complex tasks.
